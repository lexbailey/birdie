#//There are some special variables...
#//`l` is the lazy variable. You can assign anything to it but as soon as you read it, 
#//    it returns to the integer 0 as if it was undefined.
#//`m` is the magic variable, this behaves mostly like any other variable except when 
#//    used in boolean expressions such that the result doesn't always match what you 
#//    would expect for the boolean value of the variable.
#//`s` is the sticky variable. Once set to a value, it cannot take any other until 
#//    there is a call to `'US` AKA un-stick.
