#The token repeater is an odd thing.
#Birdie has been designed in a way that puts puts most tokens in groups of token type
#Consider adding lots of numbers together and then prining them:
#  '+++++1 2 3 4 5 6P
# You get lots of pluses together
#How about passing a variable through lots of functions?
#  '''''''varFUNCA FUNCB FUNCC FUNCD FUNCE FUNCF FUNCG
# You get lots of single quotes (list start delimiters) together.
#So birdie provides a way of collapsing them down.
#Simply use a backtick followed by the number of extra repetitions, minus 3
#These are all valid ways of printing "1111111" (each separated by a new line)
